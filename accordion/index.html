		<h2>What is jQuery</h2>
		<p>jQuery is a cross-platform JavaScript library designed to simplify the client-side scripting of HTML. jQuery is the most popular JavaScript library in use today, with installation on over 60% of the top million highest-trafficked sites on the Web. jQuery is free, open-source software licensed under the MIT License</p>
		<h2>Features of jQuery</h2>
		<p>DOM element selections using the multi-browser open source selector engine Sizzle, a spin-off of the jQuery project<br>
		DOM manipulation based on CSS selectors that uses elements' names and attributes, such as id and class, as criteria to select nodes in the DOM<br>
		Events
		Effects and animations<br>
		AJAX<br>
		Deferred and Promise objects to control asynchronous processing<br>
		JSON parsing<br>
		Extensibility through plug-ins<br>
		Utilities, such as feature detection<br>
		Compatibility methods that are natively available in modern browsers but need fall backs for older ones, such as inArray() and each()<br>
		Multi-browser (not to be confused with cross-browser) support<br>

		</p>
		<h2>Usage</h2>
		<p>The jQuery library is a single JavaScript file containing all of its common DOM, event, effects, and Ajax functions. It can be included within a web page by linking to a local copy or to one of the many copies available from public servers.<br>
